# FFmpegContextCommands
FFmpeg Context Commands is a suite of of FFmpeg Commands run by Windows Powershell that allow you to play and modify media files in a variety of ways. For example in regards to video - playing, compressing, cutting, changing resolution, changing framerate, converting, and more.

# Setup
To setup these commands all you need to do is download the files from this repository, whether that be via git clone or simply donwloading the zip folder, extract the main folder to a location of your choosing, and run the `Run Me.bat` file as administrator. Upon first running said batch file you will be prompted to install "required packages", you technically only have to agree to this step the first time afterwhich it will act as an optional step to update said packages. Whenever this repo is updated, to pull the new commands or changes as I add them you just have to run the `Run Me.bat` file again, so essentially the `Run Me.bat` file is your one stop shop for initial install and continuous updates.

Once you've run the `Run me.bat` file and followed the resulting prompts, assuming there were no errors, the commands will have been added to your context menu when right clicking a file or folder (depending on the command) in Windows Explorer:
